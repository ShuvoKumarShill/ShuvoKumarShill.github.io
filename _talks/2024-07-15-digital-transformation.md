## Keynote Overview

Digital transformation in the public sector is more than just adopting new technologies—it's about fundamentally reimagining how government services are delivered to citizens. In this keynote address, I shared insights from over 6 years of experience driving digital transformation initiatives at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, highlighting both successes and challenges.
