## Project Overview

Developed a comprehensive data analytics dashboard for IT operations, providing real-time visibility into infrastructure health, performance metrics, and user behavior across 300+ endpoints and 81 unified websites.

## Business Need

- Lack of centralized visibility into IT infrastructure
- Reactive approach to problem resolution
- Difficulty in capacity planning
- No data-driven decision making
- Manual reporting consuming significant time

## Solution

### Dashboard Features

**Real-Time Monitoring**
- System health status
- Network performance metrics
- Service availability
- Active incidents and alerts

**Historical Analytics**
- Trend analysis for capacity planning
- Performance over time
- Incident patterns and root causes
- User behavior analytics

**Predictive Insights**
- Resource usage forecasting
- Potential issue prediction
- Capacity planning recommendations

### Technology Stack

- **Data Collection**: Python scripts, SNMP, APIs
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL, InfluxDB (time-series)
- **Processing**: pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Grafana, Plotly
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Automation**: Scheduled data collection and analysis

## Implementation

### Data Pipeline
```
Data Sources → Collection Scripts → Database → Processing → Visualization
```

### Key Metrics Tracked
1. **Infrastructure**
   - Server CPU, memory, disk usage
   - Network bandwidth utilization
   - Service uptime and availability

2. **Applications**
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - User sessions

3. **Support**
   - Ticket volume and trends
   - Resolution times
   - First-call resolution rate

## Results

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Incident Response Time | 4 hours | 2.4 hours | -40% |
| Proactive Issue Detection | 20% | 75% | +275% |
| Reporting Time | 8 hours/week | 30 min/week | -94% |
| Capacity Planning Accuracy | 60% | 90% | +50% |

### Business Benefits
- **Proactive Management**: Issues detected before user impact
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Insights for infrastructure investments
- **Time Savings**: Automated reporting freed up staff time
- **Improved SLAs**: Better service level achievement
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized resources based on data

## Technical Highlights

### Data Collection
- Automated scripts collecting data every 5 minutes
- API integrations with monitoring tools
- Log file parsing and analysis
- Custom metrics for business KPIs

### Visualization
- Interactive dashboards with drill-down capability
- Customizable views for different stakeholders
- Mobile-responsive design
- Automated report generation

### Alerts and Notifications
